## 100 Days Of Machine Learning - LOG
#### Two reasons why I am going to log/document my everyday progress here is, 
1. To keep track of my work
2. To prepare a document sequentially based on my learning, so that It will help to other newbie's.

### Day 1: August 26, 2018

**Today's Progress** :
* Basic understanding of Machine learning - source: Andrew Ng course from Coursera
* Types Machine learning
	* Supervised learning - The main goal in supervised learning is to learn a model from labeled training data that allows us to make predictions about unseen or future data.
	* Unsupervised learning - Here we deal with un-labelled data of unknown structure. This technique allows pile of information into meaningful subgroups (clusters) without having any prior knowledge of their group memberships.
	* Reinforcement learning - In reinforcement learning, the goal is to develop a system (agent) that improves its performance based on interactions with the environment 

* Importing libraries
* Reading datasets using pandas and numpy libraries
* Read about Data Preprocessing
    * Handling missing data in dataset
    * Handling Categorical variables with OneHotEncoders
 Since Machine Learning models are based on mathematical equations, so it can cause problems with this kind of variables.

#### I will do some practicals tomorrow based on today readings and upload here.

### Day 2: August 27, 2018

**Today's Progress** :
* Practiced handling missing data - [Link for code](https://github.com/reddimohan/100-Days-of-ML-Code/blob/master/Day_02_Data_Preprocessing_practice/data_preprocessing.ipynb)
* Practiced handling categorical variables using OneHotEncoder from sklearn - [Link for code](https://github.com/reddimohan/100-Days-of-ML-Code/blob/master/Day_02_Data_Preprocessing_practice/categorical_variables_one-hot-encoding.ipynb)


### Day 3: August 28, 2018

**Today's Progress** :
* Splitting dataset into train and test Link for code
* Feature scaling
