    "#### Two reasons why I am going to log/document my everyday progress here is, \n",
    "1. To keep track of my work\n",
    "2. To prepare a document sequentially based on my learning, so that It will help to other newbie's.\n",

    "**Today's Progress** : \n",
    "* Basic understanding of Machine learning - source: Andrew Ng course from Coursera\n",
    "* Types Machine learning\n",
    "\t* Supervised learning - The main goal in supervised learning is to learn a model from labeled training data that allows us to make predictions about unseen or future data.\n",
    "\t* Unsupervised learning - Here we deal with un-labelled data of unknown structure. This technique allows pile of information into meaningful subgroups (clusters) without having any prior knowledge of their group memberships.\n",
    "\t* Reinforcement learning - In reinforcement learning, the goal is to develop a system (agent) that improves its performance based on interactions with the environment \n",

    "* Importing libraries\n",
    "* Reading datasets using pandas and numpy libraries\n",
    "* Read about Data Preprocessing\n",
